# bad_lisp

"By Austin Dumm"

A lisp interpreter written in Rust intended to be an exploration in both lisp interpretation techniques and in the Rust programming language.

bad_lisp is lexically scoped with support for standard lisp functionality such as macros and delimited continuations.

The examples folder gives a sample of bad_lisp syntax containing simple examples as well as more complex problems such as a lisp interpreter written in bad_lisp and a functioning implementation of the SHA-1 hasing algorithm.
